# leaflet-challenge
The purpose of this project was to visualize up-to-date earthquake information, namely the magnitude and depth. This information is conveyed via markers on a map that vary on size and color based on this information. In this repo there are files for the setup of the leaflet site, including the javascript file, html file and css file.

Most of the code was derived from https://leafletjs.com/
